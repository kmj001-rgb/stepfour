# Privacy Policy - Copy Highlighted Links Extension

Last updated: December 25, 2024

## Overview

Copy Highlighted Links is a browser extension that respects your privacy. This policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy and explains how we handle any information related to the extension's use.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** The extension:
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not store any personal information
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not create user profiles
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only:
1. Activates when you explicitly highlight text and use the context menu
2. Accesses the current tab to identify links within your selected text
3. Copies identified URLs to your clipboard
4. Operates without any external network connections

## Permissions

The extension requires minimal permissions to function:

- `activeTab`: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab only when you invoke it
- `clipboardWrite`: Enables the extension to copy URLs to your clipboard
- `contextMenus`: Allows the extension to add an option to your browser's right-click menu

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data, either locally or remotely.
