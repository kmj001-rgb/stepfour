# Fix: Chrome Extension Loading Error - Underscore Directory

## Problem

Chrome extensions cannot load directories or files with names starting with an underscore (`_`), as these are reserved for system use by Chrome.

The error message was:
```
Failed to load extension
Cannot load extension with file or directory name _Research. 
Filenames starting with "_" are reserved for use by the system.
Could not load manifest.
```

## Root Cause

The `_Research` directory contained example extensions and research materials. While useful for development, this directory was being tracked by git and included when loading the extension in Chrome, causing the extension to fail to load.

## Solution

1. Added `_Research/` to `.gitignore` to exclude it from version control
2. Removed the directory from git tracking using `git rm -r --cached _Research`
3. The directory still exists locally for development purposes but won't be loaded with the extension

## Files Changed

- `.gitignore` - Added `_Research/` entry with explanatory comment

## Result

The extension can now be loaded in Chrome without errors. The `_Research` directory remains available locally for reference but is excluded from the extension package.

## Prevention

Going forward, avoid using underscore-prefixed file or directory names in Chrome extension projects, as they are reserved by the system.
